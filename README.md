### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/algorand-connect-wallet-starter.git
   cd algorand-connect-wallet-starter


   ```


2. Install dependencies:

```shellscript
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
```

3. Run the development server:

```shellscript
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the result.



## Using with AI Models

This starter template is designed to be easily extended using AI coding assistants:

1. **Upload the Project**: Share your project with an AI coding assistant
2. **Describe New Features**: Ask for specific Algorand functionality
3. **Integrate Generated Code**: Add the AI-generated code to your project

Example prompts for AI:

- "Add a component to display the current Algorand balance for the connected wallet"
- "Create a form to send ALGO tokens to another address"
- "Implement a feature to display NFTs owned by the connected wallet"
- "Add a transaction history component for the connected wallet"
